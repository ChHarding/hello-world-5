Github pull-(merge)-request exercise for the HCI 584 class. 

HELLO!

The weather is extremely hot in Ä°zmir, Turkey. I will melt on my computer soon. 
This branch will explain the intentions of the project at one point, I suppose. 
The politics are super weird and they made us stress over things that would not matter in the greater scheme of things.
This makes me sad.
